# Nexus Lend Compliance Terminal - Product Manual

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?
Traditional crypto compliance is slow, reactive, and opaque.
*   **Reactive:** Alerts only fire AFTER suspicious transactions clear.
*   **Manual:** Officers spend 4+ hours/day writing reports.
*   **Opaque:** No cryptographic proof of oversight for regulators.

**Our Solution:** An AI-first compliance OS that detects, analyzes, and auto-documents suspicious activity in real-time using **Google Gemini** + **Circle Programmable Wallets**.
